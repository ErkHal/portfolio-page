          <br/>
          <p>
            I'm a {{ getAge() }}-year old ICT engineering student, who likes coding
            with modern tools. I like to take the iniative when I'm starting a
            new project, and consider myself equal parts teamplayer and independent
            developer.

            Before my engineering studies, I studied a profession in vocational
            school as a construction worker, but at the same time I knew that
            it was not the job I wanted to do for the rest of my life, and that
            is why I started learning to code.
          </p>

            I like to do a lot of programming in my free-time,
            since hobby projects are the best way to learn about new things.
            The best thing about starting a new project is when you get something
            to work for the first time, and you see the project starting to take
            the right shape. I've built home servers, an amplifier and a mini
            keyboard for my computer, just to name a few. On the software side,
            I like to do all kinds of mini apps/services on my free-time, just
            to amuse myself and learn a thing or two in the process.
